      ">> good morning and thank you  supervisor and thank you supervisors.  As mentioned, our office has been working with the coverage  apartments to initiate this policy and those departments  include the department of public  health, department of homelessness and community development, department of children and youth and families and department of human services and so you'll hear from them  today.  As supervisor mandleman  mentioned, there was a  state-wide ordinance ab959, lbgt reduction's act championed in  2019 and an additional policy in  2017 and locally in 2016 through chapter 104 of the  administrative code.  As we look at data collection  for lgbt folks in the census,  the soji data becomes much more important, because we're documents despairties, as well as identifying areas and improvement across current services throughout the city,  which champions itself on  inclusion for lgbt the community, as billion as  as well as to  identify and address policy gaps and this underscores to better  identify the unique experiences  of lgbt folks and how we can best serve them.  So as we mentioned, the census,  there's currently no national policy that requires the state or federal data collection efforts to include sexual  orientation or gender identity data and san francisco and  california has pioneered and advanced this effort and so, as  we see across the country with  donald trump continuing to  attack the lgbt people, we see it's important on the state  level. Talking more specifically around san francisco, I mentioned the  departments that are covered and  the departments are required to  collect the soji data both within their departments, as  well as their grantees, as well  as report on their soji data which you'll hear from today on an annual basis. Within the reports, they should  include an analysis of communities served, as well as a  list of programs and services  that demonstrate underrepresentation and underserved communities and  steps planned to address those  barriers across those services.  So the role of our offices, you  know, we support departments in providing guidance throughout  the process, also developing and  sharing best practises, as well  as we compile the annual reports  on behalf of the city administrators' office and share those with the board.  We also provide trainings to  cover departments to ensure lgbt  and trans-inclusion, as well as baptist practises  asdata collection. The ordinance progressed thanks  to senator weiner and supervisor mandleman.  Again it passed in 2016 and in  2017, we collected the first annual plans.  In 2018, we collected the first  reports of first-year data  collection and then we held a mid-year hearing in April of  2019 to get us status and progress update from the  departments.  So some common themes that we  have seen and you'll hear across  departments is that lgbt people  are served by those that explicitly include and reflect that.  That means explicitly reaching out to the community, as well as staffed by members of the community.  Furthermore, we found that despair  despairties in needs and access  assist lgbt folks, as supervisor mandleman mentioned we found several cases were trans-folks  were not accessing services.  Across the cover departments, we  found that there's definitely  capacity limitations in terms of needed staff to be able to be  collect and report on this data. Furthermore, you know, working  through complex data systems to  really run an analysis has been challenging for some. Because they're working across multiple different systems that  don't often speak to each other. Furthermore, all departments  have a different process in terms of how they've collected and implemented that and so that's been one goal of our  office is to support departments  in having a more unified way.  Furthermore, the training needs  are pretty comprehensive considering the size and oftentimes making sure there's a  strong training plan to get implemented both across the department, as well was within the grantees they're working  with.  So finally, just to share some recommendations which I'm happy  to speak to further, one is  really looking at a coordinated approach across covered departments, really working  together to have a meaningful  evaluation of soji data, as well  as expanding soji data  collection across city departments.  Through or work with mayor breed, we provided an executive drive  directives on all city forums  and to require training across any city employee working with the public.  So I think expanding this across the city departments is important.  Additionally, investing in training and opportunities for  staff and grantees to have access and then, also, further transparency with the public to  make sure that this data is  available in an ongoing way. So thank you. \n",

      ">> good morning, supervisors. I am an attorney and an  immigrant rights commissioner in  the city and county of san francisco. I am also a san francisco resident of district two. I question the timing of this  effort to have our san francisco police department rejoin the jttf. At a time when President Trump  has torn our enemies of hard against the racist, bigoted muslim ban.  At at a time when our chili --  children are bullied for the sound of the names, the religion and the clothing that they wear. I had a time when our corner  stores on homes are targets of a time when the F.B.I. Illegally surveilled our mosques we have waited eight years and continue to wait for the courts to bring justice. Imagine if this was your church  or your synagogue.  At a time when federal bullies riddled the body, and two years later we did not know why this happened after a fender bender. I question the timing of this effort.  We are still seething, and our wounds are still fresh.  I will say this. Chief scott and the travertine under his leadership have stood in solidarity with our community.  Thank you to them, sincerely. We look forward to being a part  of this discussion before a decision is made. Thank you. \n",

      ">> hi. I am with planned parenthood.  I want to thank the staff and  supporters as well as all of you.  We have seen a rash extreme  abortion babbs sweep the country to bring a challenge to the  supreme court to make abortion inaccessible. judicial fights have begun around the country.  Over states limiting safe legal abortion prior to viability of the fetus.  This is not just an attack in missouri and georgia.  It is on anyone who can get  pregnant. One out of three women live in those states. That is 25 million. That is signaling in san  francisco we will not tolerate a rollback of women's whites.  With trump and kavanaugh  thousand is the time to meet the legal precise dense and take a  standing on the harmful policies. The attack will continue. Abortion is on the line.  It is critical to begin the fight for rights by standing up  to the bans.  The C.E.O. Of 180 companies are  calling for the end of abortion ban. Up the opportunity to do the right thing.  Something elective leaders in  states with the harmful bans have fail to do.  I ask you to vote yes to seek to  ban travel and do business on  states with the abortion bans. Thank you for considering this  effort in this great city and county.  \n",

      ">> good morning, President Yi and supervisors. Thank you for calling this hearing to draw attention to  language access concerns and thank you to the clerk's office for arranging interpretation today.  I am the director programs at chinese for affirmative action.  We are the lead in the agent for the san francisco language network.  The network of san francisco is unique and multilingual, multiethnic, multiracial collaborative of seven immigrant serving community-based organizations, including the african advocacy network, the resource in organizing centre, the central american resource and to, the filipino community centre,. [Speaking Spanish]   -- and people organizing economic rights.  It was founded in 2012 and is funded through the office of  civic engagement and immigrant affairs to conduct community immigration to language proficient communities on their language rights through the language access ordinance. We build community power through  advocacy with barriers services and programs and to improve in-home occasion an occasion of  the language access ordinance.  In this age of trump, language  access is core to upholding century values and ensuring that san francisco remains a  welcoming city for all. The xena phobic political climate has already created a  chilling effect where immigrant families are afraid to step out  of the shadows to access critical services. Effective and culturally  competent languages support  immigrant families to feel safe, dignified and respected as  members of this community went accessing community services, which are necessary for living sustainable lives. It upholds the values of century  city in a very tangible way, but at its core, language access is a civil right and it is not  optional for the city of san francisco and the city  departments to provide language access. It is a right that committee members have. The issues being raised at this hearing are not unique to good  orchard, although we are very sympathetic to the situation that happened there. The situations that have been  happening on the regular happen  in our communities --   \n",

The department of justice is  determining whether the patriot  act will trump the other act,  and the other big issue is that the census bureau, if the citizenship question does make it onto the questionnaire, is willing to release redistricting data with citizenship as a consideration  for population, which will also  change how a democracy works.  \n",

On December 22, 2018, the federal government began the longest government shutdown in U.S. History after congress  refused funding for trump's --   President Trump's immoral and ineffective border wall. The shutdown lasted 35 days and  left 800,000 federal employees without pay, unsure of when they would return back to work.  On January 25, after 35 days and immense pressure from federal employees, labor unions, and speak pelosi, the  President Announced a temporary end to the shutdown with what  still May very likely be a  continued job because of the uncertainty of what will happen on February 15.  I don't have to remind everyone  about the astronomiccal costs of living in the bay area for people who are trying to survive here.  Federal employees are  underpaid, paid less than those in the private sector, and san  francisco has the highest pay gap.  The livelihood of federal  workers and contractors were held hostage during the  government shutdown, and it is imperative that the city be there for them.  I want to thank the san  francisco symphony and zoo who offered free tickets, businesses who offered free  laundry services and meals, and much more. There was provisions of services that we want to make sure we are prepared for and aware of. E.P.A. Inspections, national  park management, grants to nonprofits and municipal agencies being delayed, businesses who are serving federal employees, losing customers, and there's a  possibility that this -- even though it's stopped for now, May continue again in a week and that there May be unfortunately situations in the future where we have to deal with this again.  As I mentioned today, we're  going to hear from various city departments that relate to the  day-to-day lives of people who live and work in san francisco so we can better understand what to do in the future and what happened over those 35 days. I do want to say that one of the things that initiated this conversation was that there were cities and counties all  over the country who took steps, from kansas city to denver to atlanta who took steps to support their furloughed employees.  We were able to talk to many  representatives from those cities. In kansas city, federal workers were entitled to free rides on public transportation for the length of their shutdown, and all they had to do was show their federal I.D.S.  In san mateo, they've offered  free rides on citizens provide the necessary safety net and support to the  individuals who either live or work here to be supported by our city and county. I want to thank the representatives of the federal workers who are here today who you'll hear from in public comment, and we have some  particular things that we are  alrea a low-income payment  plan that has a $5 enrollment fee.  Customers can have their late fees waived, up to 18 months to pay, and there's no limits on the amounts that can be enrolled in these programs. Currently, since July 1, we have about 1900 people enrolled in these programs. Our community service program  for payment in lieu of parking tickets, actually, we're not aware of any other city in the  state and possibly the country that provides this kind of  opportunity where customers can perform various community  service at nonprofits across  the city, and we offer a $15-an-hour credit, equivalent to minimum wage. A new effort recently undertaken within the last six months, we implemented a  reduction on our boot fee,  which is when vehicles are immobilized for having five or more delinquent tickets.  The regular fee is $505 to have  that boot removed.  We've reduced that for low-income customers to $100. Another change that we've implemented recently is any of  those customers can also enroll  those citations after the  vehicle has been booted or towet.  So again, the M.T.A. Has made a very strong commitment to  addressing the need of low-income customers throughout the city, continue to do so,  and I'm happy to answer any  questions. \n",

      ">> Supervisor Haney:   thank you, chair mar, and unfortunately, it seems that we have a bit of a theme in this committee hearing about the federal government and their -- their failures and some of the ways that we here in san francisco have to step up and be there for our residents in that context.

We so appreciate your time.  And we just want to have a  conversation because we want to know who is nancy pelosi. And I think that you've been out there, we see you out there fighting the good fight, standing up to donald trump.  Doing what you do best to try and really move our country in the right direction.  But we also know that you have a  long history in the world of politics. During a time where it was  difficult for women to even get engaged.

      ">> thank you, brian. Thank you, mayor breed.  Isn't this a wonderful day? This is an extraordinary thing  to be celebrating the gilbert  baker rainbow apartments here on larkin street in the tender loin. I want to give a special thank you to you, brian. I can tell you that during the  budget process, there was  nobody who works harder than  brian basinger and the q foundation to make sure that everybody who is lgbt have a safe and secure place to call home. Thank you, brian. give it up for brian and he leadership.  I'm also very excited that we have this flag here in the  tender loin.  The tender loin is among, along  with lower pope, the oldest lgbt neighborhood, not just here in san francisco, but across the country.  It is a neighborhood where compton's cafeteria riots, the first ever documented  collective uprising of lgbt people in the country took  place in 1966 and it is a neighborhood where the compton's transgender cultural  district, the nation's firsts officially recognized cultural  -- transgender neighborhood is  here today. It's a place that, for so many years, during some of the worst  times in san francisco when the  so-called public decency laws prevented them from being  themselves. But tenderloin was an area they were provided respite from prosecution and harassment. The raising of this flag and  the rededication of these apartments for gilbert baker, the man responsible for  creating this beautiful symbol,  reaffirms the importance and contributions ofpt community, to the tenderloin, to the city of san francisco and to the  world. The gilbert baker rainbow flag apartments is one of the most important gateways to the tender loin.  And from city hall to the comptons district, we envision  a place where transgender, lesbian, gay, bisexual, H.I.V.-positive and every stripe of the rainbow lives in  a liberated life, free from oppression, free from fear of violence and secure in knowing they're receiving equitable access to shelter, housing, jobs and services that we know that they deserve. One of most shameful things I recently saw is that the trump administration is now saying that this flag cannot be displayed on embassies around  the world and when they pushed back, when they resort to the worst of it.  When they try to deny people's identity and humanity, that is when we have to celebrate this flag and what it represents, even more. [Applause]  Thank you all for being here. Thank you veritas.

      ">> Supervisor Fewer:   I'm not blaming you chief. I allowed you to speak.  This is the first time I've been  able to speak.  Please May I finish my sentence or comments. We have been receiving emails.  This is not a reduction in the police department.  You're getting -- the police  department is receiving $62 million increase.  This is not eliminating patrols.  This is not eliminating foot beat. Let's be clear about that.  That is simply not true.  I know that people love to  exaggerate and they love to  expound on if you don't do this  t then it's doomsday. This is the trumpism of our society now.  If you don't do this, then it's all hell and we're not going to have any police officers. That is not true. The truth is, I sat on this  committee last year.  The budget legislative analyst gave a recommendation that you  should look at overtime protocols. We actually approved a very  large budget last year.  And still, there hasn't been protocols put in place.  If you were sitting in my position, when we have  11-year-old attempting suicide because they don't have a home  and $500 million of ask from the  community, the majority of  people who are living on less  than $50,000 a year and they  say, I would say to them that we  would allow $2.4 million  increase in overtime but not  require any kind of protocol.  You talk about the charter, you  talk about morality, this is simply immoral.  I understand that you have over  $20 million overtime budget.  This is not saying you don't have an overtime budget.  This is saying you have  $20 million overtime budget.  You're able to work within  confines of your budgetary restrictions.  We've been able to actually achieve a lot.  I think for those of us who look  at these large budgets in the  amount of overtime, I understand  that they are repurposing money  but it is a jurisdiction of this  committee that sits here before  you to determine how the salary savings are repurposed.  That is why we are here today. It is you to bring up a  proposal, it is for us to say whether or not this be the determined, this is how this  money should be repurposed.  Let us not fight about, this is  my money, I own it because it's my salary savings.  Salary savings goes back into  the general fund. unless we decide as this  committee here, who is the last  firewall between the taxpayers  and the government expenditures that we say whether or not this  should be repurposed.  I'm not blaming you for what we've been hearing. I do blame others that are really spreading falsehoods.  It is simply quite frankly not true.  It is a $62 million increase in  the budget.  It is not true that your budget  has been cut and cut.  It makes it sound we're taking away $62 million from you.  These numbers are so big, even  on this budget committee, we have $2.2 billion budget.  These numbers are so big.  Image barely -- I can barely get my mind around it.  Behind every dollar we spend, that is a dollar earned on the  hard working backs of san franciscans.  Today, I want to say, I am ready  to repurpose the $1 million.  I'm happy to come to a compromise with you about the overtime.  I will not release $2.3 million  of overtime to your department.  Even though our wonderful harvey  rose recommends that we sweep all of it.  I'm willing to come to a compromise. I'm not willing for those of us  in this room here to continue  the lies about your budget being cut. It is not being cut.  It is being increase by $62 million.  I think that really shows that  we also really appreciate police department, chief, I think  you're going in the great direction.  I would never want your job. I think it is incredibly hard. You being our chief of police is  highly honorable work. Therefore, chief, I think it is  time that we came to a  compromise about our overtime. I think that you will see consensus on the board and we have heard from some folks here  they are willing to cut the full overtime amount and sweep that  into the general fund. However, I think there's some of  us because this board is not 100% on board with that, we have  people on this board that don't  fully agree, I'm hoping we can  come to a compromise because we  work collectively, even though we will take a vote.  We work together.  I have to say if I been harsh,  it is because of the misinformation.  I think that as our chief, you  need to set the record straight. Supervisor ronen do you have  something to say?  \n",

      ">> good afternoon. Members of the committee my name  is hung and I represent chinese for action. I want to thank you for your wonderful work. This budget season to make sure we're expanding access and ensuring transparency in this year's budget process.  You and your offices have heard  from the immigrant voting collaborative. We're excited and look forward  to the proposed spending plan coming out today.  We look forward that this spending plan would direct some of these cost savings that have  been identified earlier to go  towards community initiatives that would benefit marginalized communities in san francisco  says it pertains to budget request.  We are very -- we're very a tune to the need that exist in san francisco through strategic partnerships with the san francisco unified school direct, the department of elections and our community-based  organizations in the collaborative.  We've been able to serve 60,000  san franciscos in the five-month ramp up towards the last election. We are very excited to be able to continue to do that work  because we have a two-year  existing contract with the  office of civic engagement.  I'm disappointed this was not  included in the mayor's proposed budget but this work is  necessary and crucial given the upcoming special elections with the unified school district.  Trump has continued to stoke terror and fear in the immigrant  community and some of these resources would be very important to ensure the safety nets in san francisco remain intact. And our immigrant community  feels safe and are able to engage with trusted community-based organizations especially in civic activities  like the upcoming census that is happening next year so we look forward to your support for this budget as a whole. Thank you. \n",

      ">> I'm joined by the managing  attorney and chief financial officer.  In a nutshell, we are your lawyers, provide legal services  fo every city department, board, agency.  Assist in drafting legislation,  objective legal advice in the  city so decision makers like you  did make decisions on a common understand  understanding of the law. Defend all legal claims and lawsuits and negotiate and  recommend settlements for your approval and draft all legislation. As you well know, san francisco,  as a city and county, is unique  in california.  Run the gamut to hospitals, must span every legal specialty and practice area. The good work by our attorneys  and staff has led our office to be recognized as one of the premier public law offices in the country.  For fiscal year 2019-20, the proposed budget for the office is under $92 million.  That is about $6 million or 7%  higher than our fiscal year budget of $86 million. Three main factors in the change to our budget this year.  First, mandated salary and  fringe benefit increases.  Two, increase rent on the office  space, and higher litigation expenses. We are right sizing the litigation budget, not kept pace with inflation.  Funds for e-discovery, allows us to transfer and search large  amounts of evidence digitally. Our litigation budget covers things like expert witnesses, investigation work and other litigation costs. These are investments that pay dividends down the road in the form of better legal outcomes for taxpayers.  The only increase to our staffing is the addition of three positions.  Two attorneys and a paralegal, to deal with protecting san  francisco rate payers interest in pg&e bankruptcy and the feasibility of acquiring some of pg&e power distribution network. Pg&e situation is unique and has  the potential to profoundly impact all in san francisco. Our view is this up front  investment in staff is needed to ensure the city receive payments  and services owed by pg&e and to support reorganization approaches that protect the interests of the city.  As the city evaluates whether to  acquire pg&e facilities that  serve san francisco, substantial  legal and political work need to be done.  If the city proceeds to acquire pg&e assets, my office will present and support acquisition proposal. Additional demands on the office include upholding the rule of law and protecting san francisco's policies from the trump administration that continues to threaten both.  As you know, we have so far been successful in defending san francisco sanctuary laws and protecting $2 billion in funding that the federal government had  threatened to withhold. Money that largely funds programs that help our most vulnerable residents, including seniors, people with disabilities, low income families and foster children.  Also party to stop, to stop the trump administration attempt to  add a census question to the census. The case is currently before the U.S. Supreme court. Adding such a question to the  census is a brazen attempt to  put a thumb on the scales and  would jeopardize the accuracy of  the population count.  Including large populations like san francisco. That would correspond to a drop in federal funds for programs  that help residents like medicaid, temporary assistance for needy families, to name a few. Administration is trying a new  angle of attack, threatening nearly $1 billion in health care  and human service funding if san francisco does not allow discrimination in health care. Trump administration refusal of  care rule announced last month  would disproportionately impact women, lgbtq community and other  social and medically vulnerable populations who could be denied  needed medical services. I'm proud we were the first to  take the trump administration to court over the rule, filing the  lawsuit within hours of it being announced.  We will aggressively pursue  cases like these, to ensure that all in san francisco no matter who they are have access to the health care and services they need. We are going to defend funding  the city is legally entitled to.  Just one final, I'll skip over  some things, supervisor fewer, add one other thing. Additionally at the request of  this board, our office in  January took over handling civil conservatorships for those  unable to care for themselves. We have a legal and paralegal dedicated specifically to those cases, started on January 1st.  Set up and organized efficient  system and making solid progress and we look forward to working  with you and the budget and legislative analyst to ensure we have proper resources in place to address the city's priorities.  \n",

      ">> I'm joined by the managing  attorney and chief financial officer.  In a nutshell, we are your lawyers, provide legal services  fo every city department, board, agency.  Assist in drafting legislation,  objective legal advice in the  city so decision makers like you  did make decisions on a common understand  understanding of the law. Defend all legal claims and lawsuits and negotiate and  recommend settlements for your approval and draft all legislation. As you well know, san francisco,  as a city and county, is unique  in california.  Run the gamut to hospitals, must span every legal specialty and practice area. The good work by our attorneys  and staff has led our office to be recognized as one of the premier public law offices in the country.  For fiscal year 2019-20, the proposed budget for the office is under $92 million.  That is about $6 million or 7%  higher than our fiscal year budget of $86 million. Three main factors in the change to our budget this year.  First, mandated salary and  fringe benefit increases.  Two, increase rent on the office  space, and higher litigation expenses. We are right sizing the litigation budget, not kept pace with inflation.  Funds for e-discovery, allows us to transfer and search large  amounts of evidence digitally. Our litigation budget covers things like expert witnesses, investigation work and other litigation costs. These are investments that pay dividends down the road in the form of better legal outcomes for taxpayers.  The only increase to our staffing is the addition of three positions.  Two attorneys and a paralegal, to deal with protecting san  francisco rate payers interest in pg&e bankruptcy and the feasibility of acquiring some of pg&e power distribution network. Pg&e situation is unique and has  the potential to profoundly impact all in san francisco. Our view is this up front  investment in staff is needed to ensure the city receive payments  and services owed by pg&e and to support reorganization approaches that protect the interests of the city.  As the city evaluates whether to  acquire pg&e facilities that  serve san francisco, substantial  legal and political work need to be done.  If the city proceeds to acquire pg&e assets, my office will present and support acquisition proposal. Additional demands on the office include upholding the rule of law and protecting san francisco's policies from the trump administration that continues to threaten both.  As you know, we have so far been successful in defending san francisco sanctuary laws and protecting $2 billion in funding that the federal government had  threatened to withhold. Money that largely funds programs that help our most vulnerable residents, including seniors, people with disabilities, low income families and foster children.  Also party to stop, to stop the trump administration attempt to  add a census question to the census. The case is currently before the U.S. Supreme court. Adding such a question to the  census is a brazen attempt to  put a thumb on the scales and  would jeopardize the accuracy of  the population count.  Including large populations like san francisco. That would correspond to a drop in federal funds for programs  that help residents like medicaid, temporary assistance for needy families, to name a few. Administration is trying a new  angle of attack, threatening nearly $1 billion in health care  and human service funding if san francisco does not allow discrimination in health care. Trump administration refusal of  care rule announced last month  would disproportionately impact women, lgbtq community and other  social and medically vulnerable populations who could be denied  needed medical services. I'm proud we were the first to  take the trump administration to court over the rule, filing the  lawsuit within hours of it being announced.  We will aggressively pursue  cases like these, to ensure that all in san francisco no matter who they are have access to the health care and services they need. We are going to defend funding  the city is legally entitled to.  Just one final, I'll skip over  some things, supervisor fewer, add one other thing.

      ">> my name is steve.  I'm a member of public workers  for action and support of the  group that had the press conference in front.  You know, it's interesting, 50 years ago there was a strike at san francisco state to set up  ethnic studies program.  And for preadmissions and now we are 50 years later, and basically the program at city college is going to be shut  down, all the programs of ethnic studies. This is an outrage and it is tackling the working class. We are going back. Now, I support getting rid of trump.  He's a criminal gangster and a racist but what is going on in california? What is going on in california with the democratic governor newsom and democratic  legislature including our legislators who support legislation that attack working  class students and community colleges, that cut funding. Don't they know what they are doing?  Aren't they aware of how working class students and minorities are affected when they say you  have to complete it in two years and most of the students have to work and can't complete college in two years.  I support the ordinance for more  money, but the other aspect is privatization, corporationization. It's not only the attack on the  classes, the butchering of the college which has been supported by the board of trustees but also the privatization plan of the reservoir.  The city spent millions of dollars for developers to take over the reservoir. Working class students need to space to park. That's a working class issue.  The city paid for the  development of the profiteers who want high income residents in the condos and pushing out working class residents and students.  So this issue of privatization, corporatization, when you have more billionaires in san francisco than almost any other city in the world and we are talking about attacking city college? Why are we having this discussion and debate here?  It should be free for everyone.  [Cheering and applause] [Off mic]  \n",

      ">> thank you so much, colleagues.  I just wanted to repeat some of  the remarks I made at the press conference just proceeding this  board meeting. With the announcement that we  are introducing a mental health  assess today as an ordinance at  this board, we are very close to creating the first universal  mental health and substantive healthcare system in the country.  If you are homeless, uninsured  or on medicale, mental health sf will treat you, create a plan  toward a stable and healthy life and imide you guide you.  If you have insurance but are not getting the care you need and deserve, we will stand beside you and advocate with your prior until you get that  care and if we see any patterns  of the legal behaviour, we will hold those insurance companies accountable. Once mental health sf is fully up and running, no one will stand alone battling these  diseases of the mind and san francisco, if you see someone on street with mental illness or drug addiction, you no longer  have to walk by and feel guilty for not doing anything or debate with yourself about whether or not to call the police.  You will have a 24-hour,  seven-day a week team of clinicians to assist and that  mobile team will have the mental health service center to take  people to to get immediate care  from psychiatrists and psych nurses and we will no longer waste money, time and good will as patients and the rest of us by watching people cycle from  the street to psych emergency services, to residential treatment and right back to the street where it's impossible to stay healthy, because we will  have an office of coordinated care helping to keep people on a  path to recovery and we'll have  an expansion of services that ensures availability of beds at  all levels of treatment, including permanent support improve housing.  Mental health sf is visionary,  universal, bold and it is complete and it will soon be the law of san francisco.  I want to thank all of the cosponsors of mental health sf, including President Yi,  supervisor peskin, furer, and  brown and thanks to walton and mar resource on  r on the version at the department of elections, thanks  for your unwavering support. And also just wanted to send out a huge thank you to our staff who have worked very, very hard  on this, including my chief of  staff, carolyn gos second  osen and my  aid, and matt hainey's chief of staff.  I'm introducing a resolution  urging governor newsome to  affirm the validity of homeland security recent extension of  temporary protective status,  related documentation, including employment authorization  documents that thousands of immigrants across california depend on.  Tps is a form of temporary immigration status provided to immigrant families and individuals living in the U.S. Who come from countries with conditions that are far too dangerous for them to return.  Last week on November 4th, the department of homeland security  issued a formerral notice that  automatically extends the duration of employment  authorization documents for tps  beneficiaries from el salvador,  nicaragua, sudan until  January 24 of 2021.  They have made attempts to discourage this and this was made possible because of a preliminary ininjection  injunction from the northern court of california.  When an extension is issued by dhs, the department does not  provide the beneficiaries with any new documentation, proving the validity of their work permits for the extended period of time. As a result, man beneficiaries across the state have expressed  concerns about losing their employment because employers are unaware of the extended duration of the work permits.  This resolution urges the  governor to recognise the  validity of tps extension to encourage employers and state  agencies like the dmv to honour the continued apoliticcability of  appplicabilty.I want to thank you for bringing  this to our attention.  I have a second resolution that I'm introducing today, affirming  san francisco's support for  assylum seekers fleeing  gender-based persecution and  confirming, and undermining the survivors of domestic violence. Just as the federal government  has sought to undercut tps protection in the U.S., the trump administration has also  targeted and attacked protections for assylum seekers with policy and practises designed to shut the door on individuals and families fleeing  violence that threatens their lives and home country. And one of the most dangerous assaults on asylum protection has been the decision of former U.S. Attorney general jeff  sessions in a case known as matter of ab.  That declared those seeking asylum, because they face a threat to their lives due to domestic violence or gang violence will no longer qualify for this protection under U.S. federal law. This decision is inconsistent  with existing law and with the congressional attempt behind the refugee act of 1980 and ever since that decision, this rate for applicants from countries  like el salvador, honduras and got gat  guatamala dropped by 78%. They are trying to education  scape horrific violence at home, including rampant violence and threat to their lives by organized crime. This resolution affirms san  francisco an unequivocal support  for the asylum protection and  holding the government accountable. It's timely we take a strong  position of support for asylum  seekers in our committees for the elimination of violence  against women which falls on November 25, 2019.  I would like to acknowledge the fearless immigrant women and the  center for gender and refugee studies. I think some are here today  waiving. Hello, emma.  And for their incredible work as  part of a nation-wide effort to depend  defend the protections to so  many and I want to thank  supervisor peskin for  cosponsoring both.  And the rest I submit.  \n",

One of the main reasons why  chief scott is chief scott is  because public comment during  those meetings, you get more  reforms if you hire somebody outside the department.

The taxi companies were  basically hanging out at alamo, and they were looking for some help.  I would love to challenge mayor  breed to settle this score.

      ">> thank you very much, President Yee.  Colleagues, I call for a committee of the hearing to shine light on the implementation status of the recommended reform for the san  francisco police department that were released in 2016 by the  U.S. Department of justice. The office of community oriented  policing services. I'm sure you're all familiar with this book. If you are not, shame on you,  you should be. I wanted to thank supervisor david compost and melia cone. The board did have several  hearings on the recommended reforms, for the losses in September of 2017. I call for this hearing today  because there has been more than two years since the last public presentation on reform implementation and because the police department touches every single district in san francisco , it felt important to  have this update. Also, there have been significant changes to the  monitoring, and evaluation of these reforms and I read from  page three of phase one, the  phase I initial progress report  dated May 16th, 2019. In September of 2017, as part of  a general moved by the trump administration to withdraw from the monitoring of local law  enforcement, the cops' office terminated its partnership his  partnership with sfpd and ended the 272 recommendations.  Notwithstanding, the U.S. D.O.J.  Departure and san francisco mayor requested the california  department of justice -- many  issues have been highlighted, including use of force and  racial disparity in terms of who  was negatively impacted with the police, and these major issues are among those that are  recognized with the D.O.J. As needed reform.  We should all be onboard to these improvements.  My intention is to ensure transparency and accountability on the progress of implementing these critical reforms and it  has been too long since there was a public update. I also do want to give some  appreciation first to chief  williams got to continues to prioritize the department's commitment to reform and collaboration with the california department of justice who is now monitoring the progress. I also want to appreciate community advocates, in  particular the coalition, which has continually pushed for transparency and urgent implementation of the recommended reform.  The President Of the commission  is unable to meet today, but he asked that I sure statement from  him. Quote, since my tenure began on the police commission about two  and a half years ago, I have witnessed a steady progress made  by the police department as it  implements the justice reform. This is not just a check the box strategy. It is a general effort to improve safety in the city,  reduce the use of force, and provide greater transparency to the public. Evidence in this progress is a fact that the sfpd completed a 14 month period where there wasn't a single officer involved shooting, not one. The commission staff has been  unable to find any other major U.S. City with a comparable record. At the same time, violent and  property crimes are down, and community trust has improved. The reform effort is long-term.  In fact, it is a permanent process which will continue to  challenge the department and be the best law enforcement. I think the department and the D.B.A., as well as the police  commission and the california department of justice for the  continual push make policing a reality in san francisco,  unquote. While the board is also -- often stepped up to hold hearings on  police reform, I am disappointed that the President Has not  called for the police reforms to  be put on the agenda, considering that the police commission is the body responsible for overseeing the policy for the police department today I call on President Hirsch and the police commission to put  on the agenda this item for their next meeting.  I hope that after today we can collectively have a renewed  focus on oversight reform limitation on the department. This is the report on the first phase of the implantation.  i intend to co-opt hearings of the second and third fillets --  phase for a release. With that, I would like to introduce police chief william  scott.  \n",

      ">> thank you.  Good afternoon, board. We have a powerpoint  presentation and I will go through the powerpoint  presentation and after that, our  contractor that is actually helping us with the technical assistance and the reporting of the collaborative reform issue  will speak and then we will be a  available for questions.  First of all, let me thank you  for inviting us to speak on our collaborative reform initiative  today and inviting us to be here I want to begin this  presentation with our mission statement, which was developed through our work with the department of strategic framework, which is one of the  recommendations in the collaborative reform initiative. Our mission reflects the core values of the department that we strive to achieve throughout our  work every day. The overall objective of the collaborative reform initiative  is to work with the community to have an ongoing cultural and institutional change to improve and maintain public trust.  We hope to do this by improving police practices, community engagement, professionalism,  transparency, and accountability  just to give you an overview of the timeline, as supervisor  fewer mentioned, in 2016, we asked the U.S. Department of justice to evaluate our department and to make recommendations for improvements  across all functions within the police department.  The U.S. D.O.J. Provided 272 recommendations and our department immediately began to  work on this recommendations.  In September 2017, the trump  administration decided that the united states department of  justice no longer engaged in this form of collaborative  reform initiatives, and  basically they concluded the work. At that point, the san francisco police department began searching for a new independent oversight bodies as we continue  to do the work of reform.  The sfpd requested an unprecedented collaboration with the california department of  justice, and in that, we also  specifically requested more stringent, detailed, and transparent performance standards that we didn't have  under U.S. D.O.J. This prompted a wholesale unwelcome re-examination of all  the work that we had previously submitted to the U.S. D.O.J.  I want to note a few things here  about our continuing efforts on  the reform work. At the fiscal and technical  assistance that was drawn by the current federal administration, and during a transition between  three san francisco mayors, and changes to our police commission  , we continue to push forward on the collaborative  reform initiative.  The collaborative reform initiative is into five categories. I will go briefly on the five categories.  their use of force, bias, community policing, accountability, hiring, recruitment, and personal  practices.  I want to go into a little bit of detail about the external  engagement in our community and our collaborative reform initiative process. I think this is really important  to drive home to the board and the public about how detailed  that work is and how time -- how  the timing of how quickly we get our recommendations completed. Engaging in the community and having the community's import is the cornerstone of our  collaborative reform work. Working groups provide input on  implementing recommendations and development of policy. Examples of external partners that have attended our working  groups are san francisco bar association, the san francisco  human rights commission, members of neighborhood associations,  the league of women's voters,  the collective impact, in this list is not all-inclusive.  Those are just a few. Here's where we are in terms of  overall progress. I will frame this in terms of  the work and then try explain it in more detail what this really means in terms of what we're doing, the actual work itself.  As of mid-October, we have 343 recommendations in various  levels of progress.  As you see on the slide, it is broken down into where those various stages of in progress  works it. There are five steps in our implementation and approval  process, and they are as follows in progress means the san francisco police department is actively working on the recommendation.  External review means the recommendation has been  submitted who has been submitted   -- has been submitted to review the work. External validation means the recommendation has been submitted to the california  department of justice for review the initials R.F.I. Is an acronym for request for information and that means that  the recommendation has been returned for more information or  more work. And a substantial compliance means the recommendation has  been reviewed by the california department of justice and deemed  to be in substantial compliance. I want to pause a minute and  explain a little bit about  compliance. I said earlier that this is something that the department asked for.  And basically the reason that we asked for substantial compliance  is we wanted to have compliance measures that were transparent  where everybody knows what the endgame is end game is, secondly  , it gives us a way to  all be on the same page in terms  of our review of the work. That's the department, the california department of justice and hillary hines.  We all work by the same standards. So that was an instrumental part  in the rio can a station and the reformulation of the work after the U.S. D.O.J. Concluded.  It is our belief that that switch brought work to the new   -- to a new level. In all, we have 29 recommendations that have been  implemented and have found to be substantially compliant.  This was as of about three weeks ago. There have been additional recommendations since then that  have been substantially compliant. The majority of the substantially compliant recommendations are in the area  of use of force recommendations.  In addition to the 29, 102 recommendations have been provided by the san francisco  police department to them for  external review. And you see all the categories  on the right on the screen in terms of which recommendations  and where they sit. 170 recommendations are in  progress.  Before we move on to the next slide, I want to -- I think this will be very helpful for you all  to see what that work looks like  because as prescient --  President Hirsch mentioned in  his letter, this is not a checkbox type of body of work where we just check the recommendations and we move on.  This is an all-inclusive, evolving process that takes time  what I want to do, if I can put on the overhead, a  recommendation and a feedback  form, and it will give the board and the audience about what in progress work looks like.  If I could get the overhead? Okay. I think this will give everybody a better idea of what in progress means and what it looks  like.  because when we say we have 102 that have been cemented for  review and 170 in progress, I don't know if that paints a picture of what the work actually is.  Here is a recommendation.  44.2 that we submitted it work  packet to hines, and upon their  review, if you read through this , it basically -- their assessment that this work was still in progress. The recommendation says the chief of police should empower the deputy chief of professional  standards to create a strategy and a plan to implement with urgency the final report of the  President's task force and recommendations contained in the  pillar four in the rec --   recommendations in the collaborative reform initiative technical assessment.  So when you go down to the summary, basically this is where  hines reviewed and tells their assessment of where we are on  this and the yellow, where my finger is pointing, says this recommendation is still in progress. In other words, work is still being done.  So the evaluation at this point,  this was from several months ago , August, as a matter of fact , said that compliance measures one and two have been match. If you look down on the bottom  of the screen, it shows with the  compliance measures one or two are. Number one is evidence of  designation of a professional standards principal policing unit deputy chief, which we re-created that structure, and test was strategy and movement asian plan, which we have done that.  It also says that compliance measures three, four, and five have not been met.  Number three is simple mentation of the pillar four recommendations and 21st  century task force report. Number four includes implementation of recommendations and the report, and number five is evidence of  the review audit process to track progress and implementation efforts. The reason I wanted to show you  all this is that this is what  work in progress looks like and every recommendation -- it took  us almost a year after we  searched for new partners to look at every recommendation and  actually agree on the compliance measures. This is what a work in progress looks like. The key point here is that work in progress means work is being  done that is not completed to the point where our evaluators believe that we are substantially compliant, with the work is being done.  That is the part I want to emphasize. We have hundreds of these  recommendations in this state.  As of mid-October, like I said,  we had 343 recommendations in various levels of progress. That gives you a better idea of  what that means. We have made the most progress  in the use of force category. We focused our initial energy on new supports. It was viewed internally and externally as the highest priority. The san francisco police  department newest use of force policy was instituted in December of 2016 with a  tremendous amount of community input. The pallet -- the policy prioritizes the sanctity of human life and emphasizes training and oversight of the department members.  To date, 23 of the 58 use of  force recommendations have been completed and implemented.  The use of force recommendations focuses on policy changes such  as ending the use of the carotid  hole and firing at moving vehicles. We also emphasize crisis  intervention training. We have developed critical  mindset and coordinated response  training which focuses on a more coordinated response during critical incidents. That training has been really,  really valuable in our reduction of use of force and our outcomes  of critical incidents.  For example, there was a fairly high-profile incident high profile incident several months ago in which officers from the  tenderloin were called to a  scene of a woman who was actually ramming vehicles and she drove through the streets of  san francisco putting many people's lives at risk. That situation, I truly believe  under the prior policy May have  resulted in an officer involved  shooting. Because of the coordination, the communication, the tactics, the crisis intervention training and all the things that we are doing  , that situation actually was met with a successful resolution and outcome. The woman was taken into custody  without any loss of life,  without anyone hurt, and it just shows what this work is all about. There are many other bodies of  work that I can cite on that type of outcome based on that  type of response and we actually  recognize our officers with a cid, crisis intervention reward  ceremony every year where there  is numerous stories of those types of tactics that we used to  de-escalate and bring --  abolished these situations.  We are really pleased with that. This is an example of what this work looks like, the impact of the collaborative reform initiative.  We have also added new use of  force simulators to provide expanded scenarios for more non  use of force outcomes. The range qualifications now include time, distance, and de-escalation emphasis and that makes a huge difference in terms of how things play out in real  life situations. Statistically speaking, in  quarter one of 2016, the san  francisco police department had 952 incidents of reported use of  force and court or two, 2019, we had 544, which is a significant  decline since 2016. There's new state legislation regarding use of force that was  based on our san francisco police department policy and I think we all can take pride in  that. We not only have the foresight to change the policy, but our policy has been modelled across  the state and other agencies. we establish an early  intervention unit which operates the early warning intervention program. And what this does is it  automatically creates alerts when personnel are involved in  events that correlate with the increase of uses of force or  increase risks. Triggers for early warning sense of alert including use of force  incidents, citizen complaints within six months or four within  a year.  Any officer involved shooting, any officer involved discharge,  equal opportunity employment  complaints, internal affairs  cases, civil lawsuits, on duty  traffic collisions, and pursuits what that process looks like at the end of the day is when an  officer gets an alert in the  early intervention system, supervisors are assigned that case and basically they have to  assess and determine whether intervention is needed and whether what intervention is appropriate if found to be needed.  So that is a good system to mitigate the risk and to improve our delivery of service to the  public. The end result of all of this work, I believe, in terms of use of force is that use of force is  down across the board and we have also seen decreases in every racial and ethnic category I will pause here and say this. We still have a lot of work to  do. We know from the assessment report that there are  disparities in our city in terms of the percentages of  african-americans, female, men  that have use up on them. We are working hard to understand the data, working  with academic partners to have a  better understanding so we can address that issue and do  everything we can as an  organization to reduce those disparities. However, we have seen the  largest discrete -- decreases  since 2016 and those two groups. African-american, and latino males. We know that there's a lot of  work that still needs to be done , will be happy with the  department.  Officer involved shootings, one, if you have read the  collaborative initiative report, it really focused on officer involved shootings.  There was a lot of things, but officer involved shootings  frankly is what got us here. Officer involved shootings have  been increased since we began  this year and as has been stated  in the letter to the board of supervisors, we haven't had any  on-duty involved shootings.  I will say we have had two discharge incidents that were off duty that are being investigated, but the fact that  we have gone as long as we have without an on-duty officer involved shooting, even before  the discharges, we went over 14  months without having this and  that has not been done in recent memory.  I think that is attributable to this reform where policy changes , the community input, and all the things that we are  talking about here, the training , the policies, which I believe drive the change in the culture that the public has called for and has had a  positive impact.  Next, -- next category is bias. The san francisco police  department is committed to identifying bias both internally  and externally.  Officers on the go -- undergo extensive buys training. Examples of which include principal policing training,  creating an inclusive environment, procedural justice,  and managing implicit bias. To date, 96% of all officers of  undergone the most updated buys training.  With that, we're partnering with academic research and analyse analysers our practices and policies to understand how we  need to address disparities in  our city in terms of policing.  The sfpd has developed the first of its kind policy, including a first of its kind policy on  gender inclusivity.  The next area I would like to  talk about his accountability. We believe that accountability is the key to increasing and  building trust in our department we prioritize transparency measures that enables the public and our members to have faith that they will be treated with  fairness and respect. The san francisco police department conducts comprehensive automatic audits  of the department computer uses, e-mails, and phones for language  that indicates bias.  Our electronic communications are automatically screened  against liz's -- lists of  offensive terms and a thorough system that is provided by the california department of justice  any matches or individual -- are individually reviewed for  context and those found to be offensive launch an internal investigation.  Every sworn member of the  department has this on camera. Every sworn member in patrol,  every sworn member in operations body cameras in that unit was established to review footage and report questionable or  unprofessional behavior. The department finalized the  memorandum of understanding to enable the san francisco district attorney's office to  serve as the lead investigator in our officer involved shootings and this was a recommendation that we -- that were made several years ago.  It took us two and a half years to reach an agreement on the M.O.U. But we finally got it  done in May of this year that M.O.U. Was signed and implemented.  That increased the independence and officer involved shootings  in criminal investigations and accountability. Additionally, the controller's office on behalf of the department of police accountability is conducting an  audit on the use of force  reporting to increase accountability on the san francisco police department and to increase transparency. The next topic, the next area of  reform is community policing.  We want the community to have  consistent input and provide the  department feedback guidance and support. We have elevated our efforts on community policing. You saw that through our increased citywide presence  which drove down incidents of car break-ins and simple assault , compared to where we were in 2017, car break-ins were  down almost 80% from where we  were in 2017 and we actually had this strategy reviewed by an  independent academic nonprofit and they showed that this  strategy yielded significant yields in terms of driving down the larceny and assault where  these areas could be officers who were deployed.  We're really happy with that. At their collaboration with  hundreds of community members, business owners and advocates, with the police department  developed the first of its kind comprehensive community policing strategic plan. I want to point out, because part of this process is explaining to the public how in-depth this work is pick this  community plan took over a year. There were countless community meetings, surveys, work groups, we got controller's office involved.  There was a lot of work that went into this community policing strategic plan.  It took over a yield -- year to compile. And with the community input, we have a product that we are  really, really happy with and I  want to note, too, that the international association of chiefs of police highlighted our community policing strategic  plan in this month's magazine. With that approach, we are moving that work forward. This plan actually is a roadmap on how to build and maintain strong relationships and partnerships. We have instituted a problem-solving approach with  residents and businesses to  address specific community challenges and issues. Our community engagement  division, which was established based on one of the recommendations from the collaborative reform world, is  established reforms to present  to me the perspective of the city's diverse communities on police and civilian  relationships, as well as safety  and processes in policing and the various communities in our great city. Every station has an active advisory reform that we use regularly with the captain to provide support, guidance, and  feedback on the issues impacting that particular community. And the san francisco police  department regularly and consistently conducts town hall meetings within 10 days of any  officer involved shooting, and  we provide periodic updates with news releases and social media to the community on the status  of those investigations. The last area in the body of collaborative reform initiative  will work is hiring, recruitment , and personal practices. Our police department is diverse  we are happy with our diversity overall in comparison to our law enforcement agencies, but there  is still work to be done. Our mandate is to ensure  equitable opportunities for all who join our police department and who serve our city.  It is important to know that our officers reflect the communities  that they represent. We focused on recruitment to underrepresented groups such as  women and people of color. And over the past 10 years, we  have seen an increase in nonwhite members who have joined  the department, while women make  up 15% of the force, we do have one of the higher percentages in the bay area bay area and we  rank very highly when you look at is nationally compared to other police departments across  the country. The san francisco police department brought in academic  partners to conduct an in-depth analysis of our academy and hiring practices, and to address  recruiting difficulties.  I will say that we, along with most law enforcement agencies, police agencies across the country, are having some challenges with recruiting, but we believe that the more data we have, the more eyes that we put  on this in terms of academic partnerships in research, the better we can address those challenges.  That is what we set out to do. We have increased contact with candidates earlier in the application process, as a result  of these reviews and feedback. We have improved our testing processes to help improve candidate quality diversity and pass rates.  We also merged the recruitment  and background bureau, which at  the end of the day, we can cut significantly the time that it takes to process a candidate by  deploying these strategies.  We have also created a staffing  and employment unit to better analyse how we hire, retrain, or  retain our workforce.  That completes the five areas of reform. Now I just want to talk briefly  about next steps. Our next step we want to continue with our training  because, as I said, policy and training drive culture.  We want to scale up our training in an effort to continue to  reduce the use of forces and increase equitable policing across the city.  We want to invest in resources,  technology is really key. It is absolutely necessary to expand and sustain reform.  The better we are a technology,  the better we are with data, the more efficient we are of  understanding and being able to have strategies and policies in  place to better serve the city. We also want to develop analytical tools to better understand data and the outcomes  of our policies and procedures. Expanding outreach and increasing communication and trust is also key and we want to  do that by codifying how we collaborate with the communities  that we serve.  And long-term, all of this we believe will lead to the continuing improvement of our police department, your police  department, and drive institutional and cultural  change. Our next report, the face two  report -- the phase two report, we hope to seen December of 2019  I will turn them mike over  before we take questions.   -- I will turn them mike over before we take questions. \n",

Number two, the blue ribbon report; and then, how this  report is made out, it's  convoluted this way.  The usdoj, there was an entity  inside it called cops, community oriented police services. The first thing that donald trump did when he became President, he got rid of them. And therefore, this really  nearly thing that they had to  report, this and whatever's this, we only hear about that.  What we really want to hear  about is how the san francisco police department can use a  general orders to quickly in this great city address the issues that we want. Community policing and everything, it's within the general orders. We don't need to go through this mickey mouse.  We don't have time for mickey  mouse because too many people  are dieing.  Now, it has been stated about the black population. We're down to 2%, and when we  have something here in thousands, it adversely impacts everybody. So supervisors, some of you all will have your heart in the right place. Not all of you have it. Some of you have your heart in the right place.  Do the right thing. Thank you very much.  \n",

      ">> good afternoon. We are back again.  The taxi medallion owners to  talk about our issue and looks  like we are keeping coming back  and back but we feel that there  is no action taken.  We just feel like no one cares about us.  Basically what we want is sf to  give the money we put to this ma  dill yans back and they can rent those medallions and make the default to the taxi companies and we put a lot of down payments and some of us we need  that because there's no business in the city.  I say that if it wasn't for the  airport, we wouldn't make my any money. Because, a couple days ago, I  had a doctor apartment and I appointment and I worked from 2:00 to 4:00 in the city. Believe it or not I had two  fares and I made $25 an hour. So, that comes to like 12 and a  half dollars an hour which is  the minimum wage, right.  So what we want is you guys have  to, I mean, take actions and  push sfmta to do something about our issue.  In the contract, they agreed  that if the medallion sales program fails they're going to have to repurchase the  medallions and even issue us free medallion.  That's in the contract.  They should expect everything.  They have to give up to their signature and do something about  our issue.  Thank you.  I've been in school all my life.  I have three dock rat, two  bachelors, two masters.  I set out to say it's very practical.  I have a plan where I could solve this homeless problem across the country and I'm  seeing it's in germany and also  in england so perhaps we need the federal government involved and the U.N.  I did send an e-mail to Mr. Trump's office and he sent  out people to L.A. And san francisco to talk about housing  the homeless and so fourth.  He says that he started before so that probably the way for me  to say that ok he has a plan and it's my plan but I'm not going to talk about my plan. I need a contract first and I'm  going to mention my plan because the government won't have to  spend in any money in my plan. I'm guaranteed this housing  thing could end in 90 days to one year. Money comes no the government. he wants to use the federal buildings but as I said, I asked  the Chairman Carson to let us  have a conference and so that I could mention it once and I could be guaranteed that I'm going to be paid. By the way, if everybody was President Obama no one knows but me.  I'm the man given this ideas and if I hadn't held him, he had nothing to do and he had no ideas and everybody would have been over and no one knows about me. So I'm not doing anything free again. Nor aim doing anything which I'm not going to be benefiting from.  For my intellectual properties,  and when I spend all the same and I can't live on my education, that's bad.  In this housing move, I think that I need a contract and I need to have everybody involved  so that I just mentioned once and we can move on. Also I have interested in global  warming and I have a green plan. I notice that folks are talking  about electric housing and  electricity users so there we go again.  Thank you, very much.  \n",

And then in the springtime when the -- during the rabbit hunt when those bunnies come out of their den in the ground we'll  take our ak-47s, and 100-round magazines and blast them, we'll have a ball. It could be male bonding.  And it could happen but it's not  worth having ak-47s and assault rifles in this country for the people already killed  and maimed and scarred in their lifetime.  Let's ban these weapons. This time we have to bring the  people to the government.  Trump wants to deal with  greatness and losing to hillary by more than three million votes  doesn't help that.  And barack obama is showing his birth certificate, and thrusm is  hiding his -- trump is hiding his taxes but he has greatness and he's one of a kind. He's the greatest terrible ever and he has the perfume of  benedict arnold, one of the kind because he continues to create hairballs and one of a kind.  And I have run out... \n",

They are not the army of  hoodlums and drug addicts that are coming into our city. This is the future of our world. What are we going to do with refugees from global climate?  Are we going to give them guns, treat them with guns, bullets on walls, or basically are we going to share resources and do the best we can?  A navigation center, and a safe  injection site.

As I said before, I'm quick to react to contradictions. I find it odd that you could  say it's not going to solve the homeless problem.  That's why this controversy is taking place. If it's not going to solve the homeless problem, what the hell are you doing it for? My proposition of putting up the two towers that would solve  the homeless problem is a  demonstration of your total  incompetency and how you should  be dealing with the problem.  sfgov viewer, . Year after year after year, you  keep doing the same stupidity, unprofessionalism,  administration after administration after administration. You claim you want to help the people that have mental disabilities, but you don't even have a place to put them. But your departments come asking for millions to treat  the people, but yet you don't know where the people you want to treat are located.  Make no mistake, you had an $88.2 million negative cash flow deficit in the last several months of ed lee's life. You got that?  And you had that same deficit that you took over after you died. You got that?  People got nowhere to go on the street. You got that?  You got 80 -- you've got  $12.2 billion because of donald j. Trump. You got that?  You got that because of the tax  cuts and the tax cuts of his regulations pertaining to taxes.

I want to thank my colleagues,  supervisors ronen, walton, mar, brown, and yee for supporting our efforts and vision to provide universal mental health care for all. I also want to thank all of the community members, experts, and  leaders in the substance use and mental health field that  have assisted us with this legislation.  There would be a surtax on  C.E.O.S, and tax on the company's gross receipts is  estimated to generate $100 million annually to fund the overhaul of san francisco's mental health and substance use  treatment systems, estimated at  $70 million in new annual costs. This is based on a similar  program that has been  implemented in portland, oregon.  Similar resolutions have been considered in several states. There's also a history of funding mental health services through progressive taxation.  Prop 63, the mental health  services act of 2004, was  funded through a 1% income tax on personal income tax in  excess of $1 million. Corporations recently received  a massive windfall under the trump administration's tax  reforms which slashed the tax  bracket from 34% to 21%. Large corporations in  california were able to keep an  extra estimated $13 billion to $17 billion a year. This is a fair measure tax, asking companies that are making some of the highest  profits to give a little bit  more to get people with mental illness off the streets and into care.  The rest I submit.  \n",

We had a -- I really got to  know her when we held a reception for her at the san francisco yacht club. She hails from supervisor haney's district, and she used law, policy, and communications  to defend californiians' rights to a healthy environment. I actually know her to be more  of a fierce warrior for environmental justice and  someone who has brought some much appreciated humor to the california coastal commission where we meet around the state once a month.  She never shies away from  peppering presenters or should  I say unknowing victims with  lines of questioning.  Her student note, 2006, on the  human rights impacts of sea  level rise, was one of the first legal papers to recognize  the impacts of climate change  on underserved and disadvantages communities not only in california but around the world.  She went onto author a chapter  in a legal textbook outlining california's environmental law to protect the environment and  communities from sea level rise  impacts and now as an attorney  she applies that in her job. She was a keeper of the california coastal alliance for  eight years, and in that role urged legislative actions against polluted run off, and the ongoing damage of the trump administration.  She creates new networks and campaigns to build power in sacramento for the environment, including the blue business  council, which took on offshore oil drilling under this federal administration, and the clean water accountability projects which helped strengthen our  state and regionial water boards, but one of my favorite  stories about sarah I think  illustrates her intrepid nature  or maybe that she's just a bad ass.  In all of these meetings, we only once adjourned early.  We were up in santa rosa, california.  So sarah talked a number of the  commissioners into going on a  canoe trip down the russian river.  And not only did she beat everyone relative at the speed  category, with you right at the  top of the river, six months  pregnant, she rescued a man whose canoe had tipped over and rescued him.  It was a sight to behold.  She created the swimmable california campaign, working  with san francisco artists,  three fish studios, to design a swimmable bear, pledging to keep california swimmable,  which managed to end up hanging  in both conservative and progressive  progressive legislators' offices in san francisco.  I even got her to come swimming with me in san francisco boy ay, and unlike supervisor stefani, she did not wear a wet suit. She also founded the king tides  project, capturing the images  of ultrahigh tide events to  spur recognition of what rising  sea level events will look  like, and I actually managed to participate in this as a  citizen, taking pictures and putting them on social media,  along with many others in the  northeast corner of the city.  Sarah now serves as a water  program officer at the pisces organization. She's joined today by her  husband, max, and her son, who  I recommended be named  caltrans, but is actually named henry, and she -- who she  brings to many of our coastal commissions, to the joy of all of her colleagues.  Congratulations, sarah. [Applause] \n",

      ">> thank you.  This afternoon I will be  introducing two ordinances, also  one resolution in memorial. I want to start with the fact  that we have issues with they have been targeting young people with their colours and flavours  that entice adolescents and pulled them towards addiction to  nicotine. Companies like jewel are  increasing to increase number of people addicted to nicotine, people who never would have  picked up a cigarette.  Prohibiting vaping products that  target our young people and push them towards addiction to  nicotine and tobacco is the only way to ensure the safety of our youth.  Today alone, along with a city attorney, I'm introducing an ordinance amending the health  code to prohibit the sale, manufacturer, and distribution  of tobacco products, including electronic cigarettes on city property. I'm also introducing an  ordinance amending the health code to prohibit the sale by  tobacco retail establishments of electronic cigarettes that  require but have not received an order from the F.D.A. Food and  drug administration approving  their marketing and prohibiting the sale and distribution to any person in san francisco of tobacco products with a purchaser -- where the purchaser  is under the age of 21. This goes for flavored tobacco products, electronic cigarettes  that require but have not  received an F.D.A. Orator approving their market.  I also want to introduce a  resolution, along with supervisors ronen, President Yee , and supervisor haney, the  trump administration to stop the  massive deportation I've rehabilitated, formerly incarcerated southeast asian  nationals.  Between 1975 to the early 1990s , the united states  accepted hundreds of thousands south -- of southeast asians  escaping the vietnam war and the  genocide of cambodia.  California is home to nearly a million southeast asians originating from cambodia,  vietnam and laos. Most of the immigrants settled  in california, major cities like  san francisco, san jose, fresno, long beach, and los angeles.  These immigrants were typically placed in the poorest parts of the communities with inadequate financial support, and many of these individuals and their  children languished in severe poverty. In particular, cambodian  refugees which predispose seven  to the criminal justice system. The illegal immigration reform  and immigration responsibility act of 1966 expanded the  definition of what type of crime that could result in deportation  the bill also allowed the expanded definition to be  applied retroactively. The southeast asia resource  action centre estimates that the 1996 immigration reform and  immigrant responsibility act impacted more than 16,000 southeast asian americans, many  of whom were refugees fleeing  the vietnam war and the  cambodian genocide. President Trump and his  administration have continued to  place harsh limits on  immigration and asylum with his national policy, and he has  particular -- particularly sought out and specifically targeted immigrants in the  reentry community.  In 2019, more than 1700 nonduty cambodians were given final  orders of removal. With many individuals who are district ten residents, you have more than 20 years from the time  of their criminal convictions. These individuals have become  pillars of their communities,  homeowners, fathers, mothers,  and great tenured employees.  The trump administration's approach to deportation is controversial because it breaks  up families, and in some cases,  the returnees have never lived in their country of origin, nor they have they lived -- and org have they a living relative.  In the state of california and  jury brown starting in 2018 has taken active roles in trying to  stop to combat the massive deportation of southeast asians. So today, we are also joining in  the effort. Final piece of my business, I  wants to offer an in memoriam today, and this in memorial is  an owner of a man who was the father of natalie g. In our office.  Natalie passed away early this  month on March 1st, 2019 at  the age of 90. He came from humble beginnings  and was born in 1928 in china in  the 1940s at the age of 13. He quit school and immigrated to  san francisco for a better life.  He was parts of the last wave of  paper sons, and had to assume a different name, as well as be part of a different family in  order to immigrate.  On paper, he was part of the hong family.  He was able to change his name after the immigration act of  1965. His first job after arriving to  san francisco is to work at our father judgement laundromat to repay his debt for coming to the united states, as well as becoming a chauffeur for his  father, driving him to important  events in chinatown, and around san francisco because of his  work in the chinatown family association. Throughout his life, he worked blue-collar jobs at department  stores in san francisco, and  finally worked as a taxi cab for  yellow cab from the late  seventies to 2003.  He met natalie's mother in the 1980s in china through the  help of friends and relatives.  As newlyweds and new immigrants, they struggled while working  multiple jobs to save money. Eventually, they were able to  settle in san francisco in the mid-eighties.  Their daughter was born shortly  after. He and his wife, karen, were  married for 38 years.  He has always been humble, sincere, and hard-working his  entire life. he had a strong sense of family  responsibility and worked hard to build a foundation for his family. He was a good father and good  husband, and his legacy lives on through his daughter, natalie, who I am proud to call my chief  of staff.  He will be dearly missed, May he rest in peace.  The rest I submit. \n",

      ">> good afternoon and thank  you, and help owe, supervisor haney. I am janet lawson. I really hope we can have a conversation later on.  I moved into district six in  1995, when my only neighbors  were the pigeons and the rats who ate them. Since then, hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars both public and private have  been poured into the area to  make it a premier residential tourist and entertainment district, which is why no one  can understand the logic of selecting that particular  parcel to build london town.  I've worked in a public -- work  for a public affairs firm.  I know how community outreach works, and there was none of  that there.  We've gotten no answers to some very specific questions. The lack of transparency and  honest city in all of this  has -- honesty has undermined  all of this, and it's coming  across as nothing more than a trumpian attempt by mayor breed  to fulfill her campaign promise at any cost, no matter the cost. It's being forced upon us. It is a very foolish thing to do in this area.  This is a tourist center. This doesn't make sense.  I'd like to see one in the upper haight or perhaps lowell  heights or maybe even the  mission -- the marina, maybe by the presidio. There's a lot of places in the city.  There is no logical reason to  select this -- this location  except for it's actually her ego. Thank you.  \n",

Workers coming to work every  day is what has made walgreens  a success. Workers bring value to this company.  Workers are the face of this company.

      ">> I'm marvin harrell Jr. I'm with the housing authority.  In January of 2018, I filed a  complaint with the department of  fair employment and housing for  hiring practices and promotional practices at the san francisco housing authority. There are no african american  males in any upper management  positions. In February, I filed a complaint with the san francisco housing authority board, the commissioners, along the same lines. But also relating to their  financial practices as a result.  And as it relates to the rent  increases, and then in March, I  filed a complaint with hud inspector general's office with  the financial aspect as it  relates to rent increases and their hiring practices, etc.  in August 2018, the housing  authority placed me on ad ministrative leave for trumped up charges that have yet to be proven with any truth to it.  I'm on paid administrative leave for eight months. The relationship that I'm here today -- I could retire tomorrow -- the reason that I'm here today is because the san francisco housing authority has suffered tremendously. I have been there 13 years and  it's never, ever been managed correctly.  And the result of that is now these folks are about to lose their jobs.  The services they provide to the low-income, less fortunate individuals in san francisco, are going to go away and then they're going to be put in  disarray by a separate agency, a private agency. We're trying to prevent that.  We want these jobs to stay in san francisco. Today you guys have spoken on homelessness many times. You guys are about to create --  I mean, the housing authority is going to possibly create a lot more homeless people. We don't want that to happen. We wanted these jobs to stay and to go with the city of san francisco. Have a good evening. Thank you.  \n",

We administer the title ten  federal family planning program here in california, and I'd just like to thank supervisor  brown and the entire board for  championing access to sexually reproductive health care and taking action of this very critical issue. Thank you for standing strong for this resolution to defend california and san francisco values.  Title ten has -- the title ten  program has been a critical part of our public health system since service established. Title ten supports the funding  of quality family planning care  like birth control, cancer screenings and other preventative health services. The trump administration's  final regulations for the title ten program could did he have state california's title ten provider network and delay access to essential health  services for patients served by the program across the state.  The harmful regulations support some of the most extreme measures and policy changes proposed since the program was created. Most significantly, the regulations would deny patients  the quality care that they rely on and conflict with clinical  best practices, violate medical  ethics and current law and threaten decades of public health advancements.  This is not only wrong and  harmful, it's unhe had cath, harmful and unconstitutional,  and that's why we're so  thankful that you took a stand tot today.  \n",

      ">> I'm calling for hearing of the city's collection and analysis of sexual orientation  and gender identity data. In 2016, the board of supervisors passed legislation offered by sick by supervisor  weiner, adding chapter 104 to  the san francisco administrative code. This legislation outlines processes for covered city departments to collect and record demographic information concerning client sexual orientation and gender identity in the course of providing direct services.  With the purpose of using this data to identify the needs of lgbtq san franciscans, and  evaluating whether the city is effectively and equitably meeting those needs.  Lgbtq people have largely been ignored in the collection of demographic information by state and local, and federal governments for decades. Recently, slant -- plans add  this to the 2020 U.S. Census stalled in the hands of the trump administration. This lack of data has led organizations, including the  centre for data administration, and equality california, to advocate for data to be collected at all levels of government to help address service disparities that negatively impact the queer community.  Last year, senator harris his  quality act would require us to  be added to the 2030 U.S. Census, which is a major step  forward, but is one that is a  decade awake and fortunately caps off assess will have the opportunity to give a cutting edge of the effort to collect  and analyse this data cabin as of July first 2017, the collection became a requirement for the department of public  health, the marriage and housing got department of human services  department of aging and adult services, department of children youth and their families, in the department of homelessness and supportive housing. In addition, contractors that received more than $50,000 a year in funds are also required  to collect the data.  I look forward to working with the office, and participating agencies to use this hearing is  an opportunity to review each department's compliance plan,  the data analysis to date, including 17, 18 year end reports, and midyear data for  fiscal year 18-19, and steps taken by each department to address in the  underrepresentation of lgbtq clients.

      ">> Supervisor Ronen:   yes, thank you, colleagues.  This has been quite a frustrating experience dealing  with this ordinance and the an  antics of the trump administration. The D.A. Approached me over the break to inform me for the first time in their experience that the trump administration  was demanding that they would  extradite a man who was accused  of raping an unconscious woman in his vehicle if the D.A.  Signed a letter informing D.H.S. Of the disposition of the case -- in the case that  the individual was granted  bail, there wasn't -- the judge  didn't file probable cause to continue with proceedings or if  the individual was acquitted. This is the first time a  request like this was ever made  to the D.A.S office aside from  the fact that they've had to seek extradition of individuals  accused of crimes many times in the past. Once again, as we found time  and time again with the trump  administration, he was more  concerned about exploiting a crime than about working with the local district attorney's office to bring charges against  an individual and ensure that  individual was entitled to his due process rights and that the victim had the opportunity to face her accuser. It was more important to the trump administration to exploit  a crime and scapegoat the immigrant community than it was  to work with our officials to  pursue justice and keep our community. The trump administration has been playing games with this  particular case ever since.  First, they said that they required this letter in order to extradite the individual. Then, facing a deadline from the canadian government where  the individual was being held,  they decided to transfer the individual to san francisco.  Then, they said they would not  transfer the individual to  custody in san francisco, then  they did transfer the individual to the sheriff's office in custody, and now, they're saying they don't even  need the letter in the first place. Enough games, enough games. Today, I'm going to make a  motion to file this item, especially since the individual  has already been transferred to the sheriff's custody, has already been arraigned, has already been assigned a public defender, and the case is under way. But I wanted to take the  opportunity to be very clear, that I am going to join in the  future with my colleague, shamann walton who has said from the beginning that the trump administration is playing  games, and he refuses to participate in those games. I will refuse to ever  participate or even consider a resolution like this again. We were -- I was trying to work  with our D.A.

At san francisco airport. she's 17 months old and has been separated from her mother  and her father for months.  He's still playing games with immigrant children separating  them from their families.  They had to wrestle -- D.H.S.  Agents had to wrestle this  screaming child from her father's arms to take her away,  and now, the mother has weekly face time interaction with her where the child won't even look at her mother. This is what this administration is doing.  We will not play games with you, Mr. Trump, anymore.  Do not bring these ordinances  to us again, D.A., because if  he is going to play games with immigrant lives then it's on you. If you refuse to work with our local government in order to  bring charges against an individual where there is probable cause to bring this individual to a trial and to justice, it's on you.

      ">> Supervisor Ronen:   yes, thank you, colleagues.  This has been quite a frustrating experience dealing  with this ordinance and the an  antics of the trump administration. The D.A. Approached me over the break to inform me for the first time in their experience that the trump administration  was demanding that they would  extradite a man who was accused  of raping an unconscious woman in his vehicle if the D.A.  Signed a letter informing D.H.S. Of the disposition of the case -- in the case that  the individual was granted  bail, there wasn't -- the judge  didn't file probable cause to continue with proceedings or if  the individual was acquitted. This is the first time a  request like this was ever made  to the D.A.S office aside from  the fact that they've had to seek extradition of individuals  accused of crimes many times in the past. Once again, as we found time  and time again with the trump  administration, he was more  concerned about exploiting a crime than about working with the local district attorney's office to bring charges against  an individual and ensure that  individual was entitled to his due process rights and that the victim had the opportunity to face her accuser. It was more important to the trump administration to exploit  a crime and scapegoat the immigrant community than it was  to work with our officials to  pursue justice and keep our community. The trump administration has been playing games with this  particular case ever since.  First, they said that they required this letter in order to extradite the individual. Then, facing a deadline from the canadian government where  the individual was being held,  they decided to transfer the individual to san francisco.  Then, they said they would not  transfer the individual to  custody in san francisco, then  they did transfer the individual to the sheriff's office in custody, and now, they're saying they don't even  need the letter in the first place. Enough games, enough games. Today, I'm going to make a  motion to file this item, especially since the individual  has already been transferred to the sheriff's custody, has already been arraigned, has already been assigned a public defender, and the case is under way. But I wanted to take the  opportunity to be very clear, that I am going to join in the  future with my colleague, shamann walton who has said from the beginning that the trump administration is playing  games, and he refuses to participate in those games. I will refuse to ever  participate or even consider a resolution like this again. We were -- I was trying to work  with our D.A.

      ">> Supervisor Fewer:   yes, I  want to associate myself with supervisor walton's comments. I think we were being baited from the very beginning. I was a little shocked it came out of committee. I just want to warn us that this is a slippery slope.  In the words of bill hing, who actually wrote our sang twaer  city ordinance, this is a very slippery slope.  I want to say the reason that people are undocumented -- the  reason that undocumented people here in san francisco can live viable, healthy lives, the fact that they can take their  children to school and go to work and be part of their  community is we have put a blanket of protection around them.  And if we put one tear into that blanket, there is another  tear and another tear and another. And when every undocumented person in the united states has  a target on their back, we  should not be taking away that blanket, we should be doubling that blanket. It's not enough to say on the steps of city hall, standing arm in arm, we will stand by you. It's not enough.  It's when the rubber hits the road, we tell our undocumented community that we are there with you no matter what.  I just want to say the rest of  the united states who have sang twaer tee   -- sanctuary cities, they,  too, have signed onto being a sanctuary city.  And don't think the trump administration is raining hard on them. they are, too. In san francisco, we stand for something. In san francisco, people look to us.  When we chip away at our sanctuary city law, the rest of  the nation looks at us, too. They stand strong because we stand strong.  We have a bigger responsibility bigger than our jurisdiction of san francisco. We have a responsibility to the united states, to the rest of the world. I think this moment was actually very telling for me. I think that it is a time when  we really need to double down. The trump administration has hired the most -- I think they are very, very intelligent,  these people who he has  hires -- hired, and they're very intelligent on immigration law.  We must also be kept abreast of what was going on, but also we need to be aware that we could be baited at any time. I also want to say that I am proud here in san francisco  that we have not buckled down. I am proud that we have said with our undocumented community, we will stand  strong, we will continue to stand strong.  We will stand by you, we will  stand by our word that we have given time and time again that we will stand by you. And the rest of the nation is counting on us. And when I spoke to bill hing,  he said, you know, sandra, this is a really slippery slope, and  I would caution you not to go down it. i knew from the very beginning  that this could be very, very dangerous. So I just wanted -- I just had to comment that this is the time that we're living in.  Why in the world would we ever cooperate with an authority that has taken children away  from their families, and  detaining people at the border and of calling these people  names, and it's just been so ridiculous, this whole thing? Why do we ever, ever, ever consent to anything that they ask of us? I think the only way we fight  this is we stand united, we set  a precedent for the rest of the united states. We stand strong. In san francisco, our word means something. Thank you.  \n",

      ">> Supervisor Fewer:   yes, I  want to associate myself with supervisor walton's comments. I think we were being baited from the very beginning. I was a little shocked it came out of committee. I just want to warn us that this is a slippery slope.  In the words of bill hing, who actually wrote our sang twaer  city ordinance, this is a very slippery slope.  I want to say the reason that people are undocumented -- the  reason that undocumented people here in san francisco can live viable, healthy lives, the fact that they can take their  children to school and go to work and be part of their  community is we have put a blanket of protection around them.  And if we put one tear into that blanket, there is another  tear and another tear and another. And when every undocumented person in the united states has  a target on their back, we  should not be taking away that blanket, we should be doubling that blanket. It's not enough to say on the steps of city hall, standing arm in arm, we will stand by you. It's not enough.  It's when the rubber hits the road, we tell our undocumented community that we are there with you no matter what.  I just want to say the rest of  the united states who have sang twaer tee   -- sanctuary cities, they,  too, have signed onto being a sanctuary city.  And don't think the trump administration is raining hard on them. they are, too. In san francisco, we stand for something. In san francisco, people look to us.  When we chip away at our sanctuary city law, the rest of  the nation looks at us, too. They stand strong because we stand strong.  We have a bigger responsibility bigger than our jurisdiction of san francisco. We have a responsibility to the united states, to the rest of the world. I think this moment was actually very telling for me. I think that it is a time when  we really need to double down. The trump administration has hired the most -- I think they are very, very intelligent,  these people who he has  hires -- hired, and they're very intelligent on immigration law.  We must also be kept abreast of what was going on, but also we need to be aware that we could be baited at any time. I also want to say that I am proud here in san francisco  that we have not buckled down. I am proud that we have said with our undocumented community, we will stand  strong, we will continue to stand strong.  We will stand by you, we will  stand by our word that we have given time and time again that we will stand by you. And the rest of the nation is counting on us. And when I spoke to bill hing,  he said, you know, sandra, this is a really slippery slope, and  I would caution you not to go down it. i knew from the very beginning  that this could be very, very dangerous. So I just wanted -- I just had to comment that this is the time that we're living in.

      ">> thank you, Madam Clerk,  colleagues, I was actually going to start by talking about a piece of legislation my office has been working on for a long  time, but I will actually do that one second, and I will  start actually with the big show  , the big show is that some  $400 million of money from  heaven rained upon the city and  county of san francisco, and as with the budget, how we spend and allocate that money is really about what our fundamental values and priorities are, and we are living in a very interesting  moment in time where those  values have been expressed  through three community led ballot initiatives, what we call baby process -- proxy, and prop  g.  And I think as city leaders and decision-makers, we want to  honor that intent and bridge the funding there during the dependency of the litigation, which I believe our city  attorney, mr dennis herrera, is quite confident we will ultimately prevail. As a matter of fact, it was his  memo after the upland's decision that instructed the head of our  department of elections that 50%  , as compared to two thirds, were required in those initiatives that were not put on  by the board, but were put on  through the initiative process.  so what happened when all of that money range down from  heaven was that the legislative and executive branches hit the buzzer at the same time, on the  same day.  There is one proposal that came from room 200, the office of  mayor breed, and frankly, there  is nothing in that proposal that  is not good stuff, and at the same time, came a proposal  supported by those days, a majority of the board, but  supervisor kim had to retire, or turned down is the actual term,  and so subsequently, the mirror  issued a much more detailed pack of information, and today I would like to do the same thing. I want to thank all of the  advocates, I mean, I want to  thank the educators, and what  their idea of fair share is, in  this body's idea a fair share is maybe very different, because I think we have to balance the  little prop see, the big prop see, and prop g., and prop a,  which was energy independence from pacific gas and electric,  and I say that on the day they filed bankruptcy, as their stock  price, this is investor-owned utility, it should be a people owned and municipally owned utility that went up 16 and a  half%, as power prices are continued -- will continue to  rise, and that is a priority too today, together with President  Yee, and budget chair fewer, we  are introducing a substitute, supplemental appropriation,  $40 million for small sites for affordable housing projects, 42  and a half million dollars for 100% affordable housing  construction costs, 6 million for 100% affordable housing predevelopment cost, 9 million for the sunnydale of potrero public housing upgrades, 14 million for the acquisition of affordable housing sights  specifically S.R.O.S,  $15 million for new mass release  housing units, 15 for new safe emergency homeless shelters,  with wraparound services for two years, $6.4 million for  expansion of navigation centers, 4.4 million for san francisco healing centre beds, 5 million  for substance use recovery beds, $10 million for one-time wage credits and reimbursements for  the early child heard workers,  5.6 million for public power, utility acquisition to prepare  for the next steps in pg and he bankruptcy debacle that I just  referred to, $10 million into  the funds that you will hear from supervisor ronen about  relative to power independence,  13 and a half million dollars to  fulfil the ends of the U.S.F. Teacher and paraprofessional contracts, and make our teachers  whole.  Colleagues, I know that this too it shall morph, but as a  legislative body, this is legislative body's vehicle to negotiate with the executive branch.  I hope that we will come to a consensus. I do not want us to look like the dysfunctional congress in the trump administration. I know all of us are mature  enough to do that, had to do that in conjunction with the  community so that was going to be my second item, but after  hearing from you, I made it my  first item. My second item is, together with president yee, we are introducing an ordinance that would pull back the shroud of secrecy that has been draped  over the use of surveillance technology by law enforcement agencies, and other city departments. Too often, we only hear about the use of surveillance technology and moments of public unrest. Law enforcement has a, good  history of using controversial surveillance technologies going  back to the 1960s, 1970s,  and even in recent times. Four years ago, it was the acquisition and use of sophisticated cell phone data  surveillance technology by our own sfpd, the so-called stingrays, which were deployed on the tops of vehicles and used to scrape cell phone data off of every single person in protest within a certain radius of the  device. Since then, reports of new york  law enforcement using even more sophisticated surveillance technology has surfaced.  Law enforcement drones, million-dollar vans equipped with x-ray technology that can perceive objects through walls, software design to monitor  social media services of forecast criminal activity, to  name a few, and many of these technologies are deployed  against regular, innocent citizens and visitors to this, and other cities.  The essence of this law is to pull the subject matter out of  the dark, and into the realm of transparency and public  awareness. This actually -- we are not the first to do it. Santa clara county was before us , oakland was before us, jury  hill had a piece of legislation,  senate bill 1186 that would have mandated this for all municipalities in the state of  california, and this board of  supervisors actually voted to support that piece of  legislation on a 10-1 vote, no offence to our deputy sheriffs gathered here in, with a share of's association managed to use  her political mite in sacramento  to present -- prevents that from  getting out of committee. As goes san francisco, so does  san francisco, as goes california, so goes the nation.  Let's give it a shot in san francisco.  But basically, this legislation  would require departments that are seeking public funds to  acquire or use surveillance  technology to have a  surveillance plan and a policy that would become -- come before the board of supervisors for approval, and as to existing  technology, they would have 120 days to bring that before the board of supervisors, but most  importantly, this legislation  bans facial recognition  technology, which we know, and the literature absolutely shows, and the concerns not only come from civil liberties groups, but  they actually come from the tech industry, that facial recognition technology, which has the biases of the people who have developed it,  disproportionately misidentified as people of color and women.  This is a fact.  You can read it and countless  pieces of literature, and san  francisco is a city first, and I  am persuaded by the broad coalition of supporters, including the aclu, color change , council on american  relations. Freedom of the press foundation,  media alliance, tenth amendment centre, and oakland privacy that we are on sure footing in taking this step against a frankly  coercive and dangerous weapon.  I want to thank my staff, and lee happen or, who has religion on this issue, and has been working on it for quite some time. I also wanted to thank the public public defender for his  early support, and kevin ortiz  who helped pass san francisco's privacy first policy. If you recall, and thank you colleagues for those of you who are here, we put a charter amendment on the ballot that  passed, despite, no offence to  the chronicle reporters behind me, despite the opposition of the san francisco chronicle,  saying that we were going to have a privacy first policy in  the charger in the city and county of san francisco. This is the first piece of legislation that is flowing from that charter amendment, and I look forward to continuing to have this conversation. There's a whole bunch of interesting stuff and it. I encourage you to cosponsor it,  and I want to thank President Yee for his cosponsorship. With that, I will submit the rest.  \n",

      ">> good evening and salutations.  Hello, congratulations on your appointment as a President,  supervisor yee, too bad you are not the President Of the united states. It would be better than trump, of course,.  I was just at the campaign rally  for kemal harris in oakland, and  it was a wonderful experience, but I encountered some hatred  there. An old ghost from the past, a buddy from a year ago, just because I'm a peacemaker, because I believe in unity, just  like a lot of you do, and she said something really potent.  She said, who are we, who are we  as americans squat less answer that question to the world and  to each other, right here, and  right now.  I want to tell all of you, this is my mission statement as the  supergirl of san francisco.  I'm here to bring education, entertainment, and enlightenment to a city that I falling --  fallen in love with for the last 30 years. I'm here to call out all groups  of hatred and division and  violence.  That is not the way to unity. You can't have unity for the  sake of unity, and then tell other voices that they have to be silent because we don't like  what they are as a person and as  being on this planet.  So you will be seeing me during some -- doing some controversial things. Some fun, and happy things to  make san francisco smile again,  and that is what I am here to do whatever you have heard in the  community about me for the last two years, I want you to take a  look at my actions and my words.  I want you to examine me closely , because I am here to help. I'm here to give help.  Thank you. \n",

My name is paul, and I just want to show that here in san  francisco, we have no shortage of exceptional political leaders today we have the tremendous privilege of selecting a board  President Among very qualified  pool of leaders in san francisco some of the best leaders that the city has to offer. I would like to add my voice and  during the course of community to support hilary ronen for board President See hilary is a  type of person who stops and  thinks to herself, what can I do today to serve those who are hurting most among us while  those who need most among us while she is a person who shows  up for us every single day. She shows up for homeless families, she shows up for immigrant communities, and she shows up for public school  families. We have two years left in the trump presidency. Right now we have the opportunity to elect a President  To a standard form and defend  our values as san franciscans. We are above the double standard  of awarding the ambitious men pursuing leadership and questioning ambitious --  ambitious women who are questioning leadership. Hilary is qualified.  She is exceptional, she is intelligent, and she will work closely with our mayor to steward the city into the next decade.  I ask that you support her  presence -- presidency today.  \n",

      ">> thank you very much. I wanted to take a moment to say  congratulations to all the new  supervisors. Some we have worked with for a  while, and very successfully, and some that are new that I have worked with really closely  before as supervisor haney and supervisor walton, I have been on the board with them before,  and I think we have done some pretty interesting things on the board of education, trying to change the status quo up a little.  I know we will have a great working relationship, and of  course, the twin brother of my  predecessor, gordon mar, we have  worked together before on many things. I'm proud to say I supported every single one of them.  I feel like we really one- -dash we really one this year. I also want to associate my  comments with that of joe wilson , and who I worked with as  community organizers.  He has always been wise, but today he said something very wise. After this vote, we will all work together, and that is actually what is expected of us.  This is not about individual  power. This is clearly about collective power. We have been given an  opportunity, a progressive majority on this board to actually help level the playing  field, so I just want to say,  that when I was campaigning, and when I'm out on the streets  today, I see seniors that are losing their housing in my  neighborhood, and I want to say  to them, I see you.  For all the undocumented folks that are fearing what trump could do next, it is why I  actually helped to fund and create immigration defence funds in the public defender's office, and also to write the resolution to impeach trump.  i see you too. I see the working working-class folks of san francisco  struggling every day, some who  have not made it, and then some who are just barely hanging on. I want to say to you, I see you  too, and I think all of us on  this board, we see a huge  inequity and what a wealth gap  like this can do to everyday working san franciscans, and  those poor or not working, with struggle so hard to stay in this  wonderful, fabulous city. When you say to somebody, vote  for me, it is very heavy, it is a very profound, it is such a  commitment, it is sometimes hard to get it out of your mouth to say vote for me, and believe in  me. But everyone here today who is  elected here, has said that two people, and people have believed  in them, and people said, I will vote for you because I believe  in something better for me, the single mom, for the black community who hasn't been able to get an economic base here in  san francisco. I think all of us here on the board, we will come together,  and I hope we will to work together collectively. There are thousands and thousands of people who are  depending on us to do our job,  and to put differences aside, and any hurt feelings, or  anything else aside, because it  is not about us, but frankly, it  is about the people that we have  sworn in to serve on a raise our right hand, and we swear the oath of office.  These people are depending on us I'm so glad to hear that hillary  and norman will hug each other and love each other again, and  that will they will kiss and makeup.  I I want to say today, I want to thank everyone who came out today to speak. Because this is the essence of our democracy.  Democracy is messy. Today we all heard what you had  to say. We all get it. We all understand it, we all heard it.  We not only heard it with our minds, but with our hearts to,  and in hearing that, the most important thread that I heard  today was we are about to change  we are about hope, we are about change, we have a progressive majority, we are looking for relief, and we are looking for  help, and this is what the board  must deliver to every resident in san francisco.  So I hope our communities, whatever the board vote is, I  hope the communities will heal,  it will take not just us here at  the board to make those changes,  it will take everyone to do it. It will take a collective,  collective power here, again, this is not about individual  power, this is so much about  collective power here, and so, I  hope that we will all come together after this vote, and we  will see that what we can set up for working-class folks in san  francisco, how we can equalize the playing field a little, how  we can join hands together and say we can build a better san  francisco for all of us, where we are all included here.  And I say that also as someone who was a fourth-generation san  franciscan whose grandfather  came here on illegal papers, that the struggle here has not  been easy for a lot of us, and the pathway here to the united  states has not been the same for  everybody. I just want to caution folks  also that we are up for a big fight this year with the federal  government, it will take all of us to join hands and to fight  against this type of evil power, which is unprecedented, and we  have never seen before.  Again, thank you so much for everybody coming up, congratulations to our new supervisors, congratulations to  their families.  I know that they will do wonderful, wonderful things for the city and county of san francisco. This is the ultimate public  service. And thank you to your families  for sacrificing them to do this  good work of being your public servant in san francisco. Thank you. \n",

You ask why we are here. I'm being retaliated against.  The address is 3847 -- 3849 18th street.  We are hearing it on December 18. We have heard it twice before. You have the videos in your brief from us.  Please watch it.  That's why Mr. Hernandez and Mr.  Duffy were so tongue-tied around  what the hell was so wrong with the building that we had to revoke the permits. What safety issues were there? It's me. That's why they are doing this. They are trying to get back at me. They are holding it over my head  so that I let that project go  and stop pursuing it.  Commissioner honda called me up. Offered a quid pro quo,  basically, and I said to him, look, darryl, I told you when I  first met you, I cannot be bought. And I still cannot be bought. And I feel uncomfortable talking  about this right now.  You should tell him and his crew  to go fuck themselves. Quote. That's why we are here. Why do you want a special permit?  Because Mr. Hernandez said you have to come back to me, I'm going to make your life miserable. This is out of control, criminal activity.  It will be investigated. Trust me.

I couldn't get through the front doors of city hall.  I given all my research to katherine stephanie.  Of late I think the world health world health organization there's a probable cause with this technology  coming at us quickly. When my neighbors have a  problem, I come out and support them.  As I'm supporting Ms. Hogan. There was a telecommunication company that tried to get into  the building where I live and we  had to fight them for two years.  Sorry to use the word fight. I told them it's not going to happen in this building because it would change the  interestingty of the building.  A.M., F.M., whatever your frequency, it all goes through the human body. What I'm really concerned about  is who's making the equipment.  Sorry to say this in the city, I support President Trump on this  issue of the chinese communist  party and the military behind 5g.  There's some counties and states  that are not accepting this.  What's happening in hong kong  and taiwan and communist party I'm concerned about.  This is the ruthless gang that  wants to control the world.  One of the safeguards is to defend our independence, our  internal freedoms and our  liberties here in the united states.  This is big concern about 5g. I really don't know where this is going, there's surveillance and it's coming. There's a new global surveillance that's watching the whole planet.  I question who's watching from  what reasons. I think that we have to preserve  our liberties, our freedoms especially internally.

Used to do that, you came back out?  So anyway, I'm not into litigation but my name is ace  and I'm in the community, I can  speak the way I want to speak. You are going to go back and  speak on with argie, I have known him for years, this lawsuit he got going against y'all, I can speak, I'm like trump. I know you are going to speak about that.  The issue is, case in point,  y'all know I've been coming here religiously actionings before  y'all turned over to ocii to  come to the fillmore, it ain't like I'm slapping you in your face.  But no, this is ace in your face. Even though y'all got a case,  I've been on the case.  And I'm willing to testify however, whoever wanted.  My opinion on augie, he's not going to split up my community and not get away going after the  queen, not in front of me, the  queen is london breed, ok? What do you think he's doing by filing a lawsuit against y'all,  but then hold up. Isn't the city and county filing a lawsuit against, how do you pull up that balance there? My name is ace, damn it, I'm on the case. I got a story to tell.  Now, let's do it this way.  I got three options for y'all. Recommendations.  Sit down and have a meeting with your executive staff and your  lawyers with case ace on the  case, fillmore ambassador, allow  me to come before you and make a  presentation about the fillmore, include everything. y'all bring your bones out to  the fillmore, I've been asking  you for years, let's have a  community town hall meeting.  I'm appalled.  Now, in speaking politically  speaking, london should not be  involved with this, although her name is involved with this. If I had to somebody people,  when I go up there and talk to newsom about what's going on here, he's going to say ace,  what the hell's going on.  So in closing, my name is ace, I'm on the case.  You let aggie know, community reform, community, court of community needs to do this in  order to be down in there, with he can settle this if he wants to be about the community. I don't want our community split up no more than it has to be, because I'm going to create community reform from this  issue.  \n",

But stand pg up here as a black  man, 64 years old, with God's  help, I'll be 65 next year, next month.  So, respectfully requesting,  don't buckle in -- listen, I can  say that, I'm like trump.  Don't buckle into augie. Community opinion, y'all gave him so much money.  I brought him to the fillmore. Way before y'all, you made no sense, when you had the game,  when y'all wanted a black man to  come on fillmore, I brought him,  I'm the negro who did that. So, I'm going to be in court to  let them know it's two sides.  I'm going to talk to augie, saying that, brother. You have two properties now on fillmore, you wanted three, he  wanted to be like -- he wanted  to be like the fillmore seno,  excuse me my sister from another country, it's nothing personal.  We as black folks, from the city  and county by the bay, not saying we are pitting ourselves against thee, but the african  american, I could speak on outmigration.  African americans, immigrants,  if you take y'all from our black population, our population is way down.  You know who knows, governor  brown, he's gone, but newsom know, I'm the fillmore corridor ambassador.  And on top of that, dog gone it, I was the last executive  director of waypack, you know  you don't want me to bring that back. Yes, I am.  I'm tired of all the people saying we were together for 20  years, 30 years, the umbrella of fact.  I took all my teaching from.  Ain't been no one man band, information, and informed  community is an empowered community. What does my community know what  I know, we'll be empowered.  So, bring back waypack, that's a fact, how do you like that, now  run and tell that.  My name is ace, dog gone it, I'm on the case and the legacy show  is still on for the black americans that helped the city by the bay.  Thank you.  \n",

      ">> Miss Selby, thank you very much.  In the last couple of months, I have met with two companies that  claim to do electric cars for tn cs and they are applying to  the california puc for licenses, using electric vehicles. That is simply not acceptable.  So if you want to look into the  future, we are not -- so this is -- I think this is tricky is  I'll be frank with you, because  it is about this feeling, if you  use an electric car, we're lowering emissions and it's ok. It is still not ok because san  francisco has invested billions  of dollars in a transportation infrastructure and therefore, it is not ok and shouldn't be a  part of this culture of, oh,  well, for an environment, I'll  just take now an autonomous vehicle which is an electric  vehicle versus a lytt or uber using fossil fuels and I feel better about it.  That is not a better choice and they shouldn't feel better about it, but when we accept this, that is a slippery slope.  I want to say that I'm glad to  hear you say you're not fully on  board with the one-cent sales tax. When we look at the wealth gap  and on the backs of hard-working  san francisco, you look at fresno and the low-income folk  who's are getting hit hard, especially by this trump administration that a one-cent  sales tax is not sitting well with me.  I get you're not saying that and this gentleman did.  I'm sorry I disagree with you is  I think big business should be paying more because the President Has given them a huge tax break.  This will help them and this employee-based program, ok, I think that's great. Let put down the real bucks of billions of dollars, actually,  from their companies and to help us with this transportation infrastructure. It only helps them and their businesses and I don't think we  should be so quick to say a one-cent sales tax and then let them off the hook.  If so I just wanted to address that. None of this is, of course, personal and this is really  just, I think, that when we are  looking at our constituents in sanfrancisco, it's hard to stay  to my responsibilities and invest in one-cent sales tax  because in the west  westside, we're  running 38 garry and we're already 106% over capacity.  So unless we're looking at a an  refrigerator equitable in my neighborhood, sending underground rail to my neighborhood because we are  growing from, too, and I think  this will be a hard sell for my hood.  I'll be honest, one-cent sales  tax, to acts my residents to pay that and know a lot of this refrigerator  infrastructure will not get them better structure and even though  I know it's one of your guiding principles, it's a hard case to make.  Thank you.  \n",

      ">> thank you. By the way, just so we are all  clear, there is a real  partnership between these three counties and there was no better  expression of that than when the  trump administration had second  thoughts about giving $6,747,000,000 to the electrification project, and every supervisor and every mayor  up and down the corridor are made that happen, so it is now  happening and in light of that,  it is on-time and and on budget. We all have a lot of work to do  to make this thing for the 21 st century, I think first  and foremost, is how we figure out a new government structure, or the J.B.P.  I don't come to that with any  preset conclusions.  I think we just need to have an honest, candid conversation to make it be the best railroad that it can be and to get us what we need, which is downtown  extension. With that, Mr. Hartnett, anything you want to add? \n",
